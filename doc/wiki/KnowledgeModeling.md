## Summary

## ODM

[ODM][odm] defines a set of MOF metamodels and UML profiles - collecively, albeit in non-normative terms, an MDA module - for visual, model-centric representation of a range of declarative languages including RDF, OWL, XML Topic Maps (ISO TMDM), and Common Logic. In turn, MOF and UML define conventions for normative, graphical representation of - respectively - metamodel and model elements, in a normative, abstract syntax. 

Project Lupine proposes to provide explicit support for the ODM MDA module, as for purposes of intetrating RDF, OWL, TMDM, and Common Logic constructs and meta-constructs into more commonly known MDA modules such as SysML, SOAML, and UML itself, as well as for original MDA modules that may be developed in Project Lupine or in projects reusing components that may be developed of Project Lupine, such as [SpaceOWL][spaceowl], [Athtology][athtology], [#ArsDB][arsdb], the [Clyde Project][clyde], the [Gazebo Hub][ghub] project, and others.
